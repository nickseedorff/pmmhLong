Description: Latent gaussian processes can be used to model multivariate count data 
    by including available structural or functional distances between observations. Traditional MCMC
    approaches can be slow in this setting given the dimensionality of the unknown parameters and
    may have difficulty convering due the the flatness of the posterior distribution. Here
    we implement and efficient Pseudo-marginal Metroplis Hastings approach that uses an unbiased
    estimates of the marginal likelihood based on laplace approximations.
